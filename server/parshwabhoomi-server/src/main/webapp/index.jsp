        <p align="justify">
            Parshwabhoomi is an implementation of user context based custom search.Right now,
            the application uses user's location as the context & tries to retrive the search results
            that match the user profile that's registered with the app on the server.
            The local business vendors also register themselves with the app for their business
            offerings & advertisements.These vendors feature in the user's search results on top.
